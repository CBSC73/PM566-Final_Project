class="section level5">
<h5>Background: Influenza virus infection represents a significant
disease burden on pregnant women and infants in the United States (1).
Pregnancy and infancy (under 1 year of age) are times of relative
immunosuppression and vulnerability to certain types of infection (2).
Influenza virus has long been recognized as particularly virulent in
pregnant women (3, 4) with an increased risk for hospitalization, ICU
admission, and death (5). During the 2009 H1N1 Influenza pandemic,
pregnant women had a five times higher risk of death from Influenza
virus infection and associated serious morbidities (such as
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia superinfection and acute respiratory
distress syndrome) than the general population (6-8).</h5>

class="section level5">
<h5>Immunization during pregnancy creates IgG antibodies that cross the
placenta and enter fetal circulation where they remain for approximately
six months (9, 10). Breastfeeding also transmits maternal antibodies
that protect newborns from infections (9). Antibodies acquired in the
pre- and peri-natal periods protect babies after birth until at least 6
months of age (11). This is critical because infants are not eligible
for Influenza vaccination until 6 months old (12). Indeed, infants under
6 months old have the highest rates of hospitalization related to
Influenza virus infection of any age group, including older adults.
Rates are estimated at 4.5 hospitalizations per 1000 children (13),
which given approximately 4 million babies born each year, translates to
nearly 18,000 hospitalizations. In addition to the human costs of caring
for a sick infant, this represents a multi-billion-dollar burden on the
medical system, especially as these infections are compressed into the
December-March timeframe (“Flu season”) (47).</h5>

class="section level5">
<h5>Prenatal exposure to maternal influenza infection is known to have a
negative impact on long term childhood outcomes. Indeed, vaccination
against influenza during pregnancy is associated with a reduced risk of
preterm birth, small for gestation age status (indicating poor fetal
growth), and low birth weight (less than 2500g or 5.5 pounds) at
delivery (14-16). The strong associations between the above morbidities,
especially prematurity, with worse long term neurodevelopmental
outcomes, is well established (17-21). In addition to the above, several
studies have found an association between Influenza infection during
pregnancy (22-24), especially during the first trimester, and later
development of autism spectrum disorders in offspring. Indeed, children
conceived in the winter months (December-March, peak Influenza season)
have a 6% increased risk of autism spectrum disorder. Similarly,
schizophrenia, a devastating neuropsychological disorder that most often
presents in early adulthood has been linked to first trimester prenatal
influenza infection exposure with a 7-fold increased risk (25). Bipolar
disorder has also been associated with prenatal Influenza infection
exposure with a nearly 4-fold increased risk (26).</h5>

class="section level5">
<h5>The yearly influenza vaccine has a long track record of safety and
efficacy during pregnancy and is recommended by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG)
for all pregnant women (27, 28). The World Health Organization (WHO)
recommends a minimum 75% vaccination rate among the population to
protect those at highest risk for severe infection (29). In fact, the
WHO considers pregnant women to be the highest priority Influenza
vaccination group for countries initiating or extending Influenza
vaccine efforts (29). It is well documented that the Influenza vaccine
during pregnancy is effective, reducing proven Influenza virus infection
in infants 0-6 months of age by up to 63% and in pregnant women by over
50% (11, 14). In the U.S., despite the strong recommendation by the CDC
and the American College of Obstetrics to be vaccinated against
Influenza, many pregnant women are not. <br> This report examines
influenza vaccine rates among pregnant women in the U.S. and looks at
trends over time using qualitative analyses of publicly available

<h5><strong>Data Cleaning and Wrangling</strong>: Data was downloaded
directly from the CDC website as a text file with comma separated
variable datapoints. The years 2012-2020 were covered and vaccination
rates for Influenza as well as Tdap were included. As my interest is
Influenza vaccination, Tdap data was removed. New York City, Puerto Rico
and the District of Columbia were also in the dataset, however I removed
these as my interest is in the 50 U.S. states. The dataset did not
report data on all 50 states for all years. In 2012, only 29/50 states
had data. In 2020, 39/50 states had included data. Age group and
race/ethnicity data were included in the dataset, with both national and
by state information. The age and race/ethnicity data were reported
separated (not within each subgroup with respect to the other variable)
and thus were not able to be examined simultaneously (i.e. examining age
group trends by race/ethnicity).</h5>

class="section level5">
<h5>Missingness was examined as a whole and by variable. Overall, there
were found to be 267 missing observations out of 2,470 (10.8%). Breaking
this down by variable, I found that within the age group data, only 12
out of 1,244 observations were missing. As this only represented 1% of
data points, these were removed. Within the race/ethnicity data, 255 out
of 1,226 observations were found to be missing (20.1%). Separating out
the missing values by national versus state data, it was found that all
missing values were from state specific race/ethnicity data. Given the
20% missingness rate for this subset of the data, and likely
introduction of inaccuracies with attempted imputation given variability
in state participation in the survey each year, I decided to only
examine race/ethnicity on a national level. A region variable was
created using states by region specified on the CDC website (states were
divided into West, Midwest, Northeast and South). Duplicate rows were
examined for and removed. Summary statistics were performed to check for
implausible values and none were identified.</h5>

<h5>National – The Influenza vaccination rate among pregnant women in
the U.S. is increasing. Despite not all states reporting for each year,
a national overview between 2012 and 2020 (Figure 1) shows a clear
increase over time. In 2012 the national vaccination rate for all women
over the age of 18 was 47.4% (N=31, 507), and by 2020 it had increased
to 61.1% (N=40, 339). This represents an increase nationally of

<h5>Region - Next, Influenza vaccination rates were evaluated by region,
comparing the year 2012 to the year 2020 (Figure 2). The Midwest region
had the largest increase in median vaccination rate, starting at 49.1%
in 2012 up to 70.95% in 2020, a nearly 22% increase. Conversely, the
South had the lowest rate increase, from 43.6% in 2012 to 54.3% in 2020,
a 10% change. All four U.S. regions had increased vaccine rates over
time, with the Northeast having the highest rates (72.4% in 2020) and
the South having the lowest (54.3% in 2020). In 2012 the vaccination
rate in the Midwest region was below the Northeast and West, however in
2020 it overtook the Western region with rates close to the Northeast by
2020 (Midwest vaccine rate in 2020, 70.95%).</h5>

groups: “Black, non-Hispanic”, “Hispanic”, “White Non-Hispanic”, and
“Other or multiple races, Non-Hispanic.” Data trends between 2012 and
2020 are demonstrated in Figure 5. Women in the Other or multiple races,
non-Hispanic group had the largest increase in vaccination rate between
2012 and 2020, with a 21.3% increase (from 48.7% to 70%). This group
overtook White, non-Hispanic women in 2014 and has had the highest
Influenza vaccination rate since that time. White non-Hispanic women
have also increased their rates by 16%, from 49.5% in 2012 to 65.5% in
2020. Black, non-Hispanic women have by far the lowest vaccination rate
in all years examined. After an initial 14% increase in vaccination from
2012 to 2016 (36.1 to 50.4%), rates are decreasing among this group with
a 2020 rate of 41.6%. Hispanic women are the next lowest group though

<h5>The Southern U.S. continues to have the lowest vaccination rate in
the country. This gap has widened between 2012 and 2020, from 6 to 15
percentage points lower than the next lowest region. This is likely a
multifactorial phenomenon, however two of the most influential
demographic characteristics that predict vaccination status are
insurance (private vs public) and level of education (30). This dataset
did not address these factors directly. However, the South is the U.S.
region with the lowest rates of college completion (28.2% in 2021,
versus the Northeast with 34.8%) (31), and highest rates of public
insurance recipients (32). Indeed, access to medical care is a known
barrier to vaccination in the general adult population (33). One
promising intervention is education of providers and public health
interventions that target medical clinics which have been quite
effective in improving vaccination rates (34-36). Settings in which a
provider can recommend and administer a vaccination at the same visit
are particularly effective (34). These types of efforts, focused on the
Southeast, especially Georgia and Florida have strong upward potential.
These are large populous states where even a small improvement
translates into many thousands of women and their children being
protected.</h5>

class="section level5">
<h5>As women get older, they are more likely to be vaccinated against
influenza during pregnancy. Older women also had the largest increase in
vaccination rate between 2012 and 2020 suggesting this demographic is a
primary driver of increasing vaccination rates nationally. One potential
basis for these trends is the average age of a first-time mother is
increasing in the U.S. It was 21 years of age in 1972 and has risen to
an average age of 30 as of 2022 (37). The percentage of total
pregnancies that are to older mothers has also increased while those to
the youngest has decreased (37). Interestingly, a strong predictor of
maternal age at first pregnancy is level of education, specifically
ascertainment of a college degree (38). Education level and maternal age
are inextricably linked. Finishing a four-year degree leaves most people
at age 22-23 years at time of completion and the costs of post-secondary
education in the U.S are rising rapidly (39). Though not looked at
directly in this dataset, education is a likely primary driver of the
linear relationship between age and vaccine uptake. (For a closer look
at these trends at the New York Times, featuring interactive maps on
this subject, see <a

<h5>The race/ethnicity findings in this data demonstrate significant
gaps in influenza vaccination between women who identify as Hispanic or
Black, non-Hispanic versus White and “Other” ethnic categories. These
disparities are likely reflective of socioeconomic inequality and
reduced access to healthcare and educational opportunities in the U.S.
(40-41). The COVID-19 pandemic shed a stark light on the how care is not
equal between racial and ethnic groups (42). Troublingly, vaccination
against influenza among pregnant women who identify as Hispanic, has not
changed in many years, and for those who identify as Black, rates are in
fact decreasing. These trends highlight the importance of
community-specific public health outreach.</h5>

<h5>There are some notable weaknesses of this dataset that limit
available analyses. As noted in the methods, not all 50 states are
included for each year of data. This reduces generalizability of
national data as some states are more represented than others.
Furthermore, due to lack of reporting of certain states, region data is
less representative of the true vaccine rate. For instance, California
is not reported in any year. Given that approximately 12% of the U.S.
population lives in California, this is a significant limitation to
accuracy. When examining by region, this problem is heightened as the
state represents an even larger percentage of the population for the
Western region. (The California Department of Public Health tracks
influenza vaccination among pregnant women in the state using the
Maternal and Infant Health Assessment, a statewide survey. For further

<h5>Influenza vaccination uptake among pregnant U.S. women is
increasing, reaching over 60% in 2020. Despite this positive, trend,
vaccination rates remain suboptimal, well below the WHO recommended 75%.
By region, the South is the least (54.3%) and Northeast the most (72.4%)
vaccinated areas of the country. Women who are younger, and identify as
Hispanic or Black, non-Hispanic are less likely to receive the influenza
vaccine than women over the age of 35 who identify as either White or
Other, non-Hispanic ethnic group. Reasons for these observations are
multifactorial, and likely represent an interplay between levels of
education, access to quality prenatal and preventative health care, and
racial/ethnic socioeconomic disparities in the U.S (43-46).</h5>
